# ðŸ”¥ Updated Firestore Security Rules

## Current Issue
The API routes are trying to store data in collections like `website-contacts/contact-forms`, but Firestore doesn't allow subcollections in this format. The error shows:

```
Invalid collection reference. Collection references must have an odd number of segments, but website-contacts/contact-forms has 2.
```

## Solution
Updated the API routes to use direct collections instead of subcollections:

### New Collection Structure:
- `contact-forms` (instead of `website-contacts/contact-forms`)
- `brochure-downloads` (instead of `website-contacts/brochure-downloads`) 
- `newsletter-subscriptions` (instead of `website-contacts/newsletter-subscriptions`)

## Updated Firestore Rules

Replace your current rules with these:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users collection - users can read/write their own data, admins can read all
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
        exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)) &&
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
    
    // AI Sessions - users can only access their own sessions
    match /aiSessions/{sessionId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Tests - Users can only read/write their own created tests
    match /tests/{testId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.createdBy;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.createdBy;
    }
    
    // Test Attempts - users can only access their own attempts
    match /testAttempts/{attemptId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Study Plans - users can only access their own plans
    match /studyPlans/{planId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Website Contact Forms - Public write access for form submissions, authenticated read
    match /contact-forms/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if true; // Public write access for form submissions
    }
    
    // Brochure Downloads - Public write access for brochure requests, authenticated read
    match /brochure-downloads/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if true; // Public write access for brochure downloads
    }
    
    // Newsletter Subscriptions - Public write access for subscriptions, authenticated read
    match /newsletter-subscriptions/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if true; // Public write access for newsletter subscriptions
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Update Rules

1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database â†’ Rules
2. Replace the existing rules with the updated rules above
3. Click "Publish" to save the changes

## Expected Result

After updating the rules, form submissions should work properly and data will be stored in:
- `contact-forms` collection for contact form submissions
- `brochure-downloads` collection for brochure download requests  
- `newsletter-subscriptions` collection for newsletter signups
